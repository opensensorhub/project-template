This folder contains **Data Files** to be included in the package.

They can typically be OSH embedded database files or other data files used by sensor drivers or storage implementations.

There is a limit of 100MB per file on GitHub so the larger files cannot be stored here directly. Larger files can be stored as GitHub releases though (or even outside of GitHub) and can optionally be included here using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
