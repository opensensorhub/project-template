## OSH Package With Source

When OSH modules are developped very specifically for a project, they can be included directly in the project repository instead of a module repositories such as osh-sensors or osh-persistence.

In this case, the module source code is included inside the osh-package folder like 'sensorhub-template-project' in this example.
