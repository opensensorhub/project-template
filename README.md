# Project Repository Template

Project repositories are prefixed with `project-` and are created everytime we deploy OSH for a specific project or application. These deployments most often correspond to demonstrations involving a server running OSH, some web application based on the OSH Javascript toolkit, and sometimes specific Android or iPhone apps.

They are used to collect all source code and information useful to build and deploy the demonstration at a later time, including:

* Build, Deployment and User documentation in Markdown format
* Source code for HTML/JS web clients
* Data files (or links to data files if too large to be hosted on GitHub)
* Submodules to point to exact version of OSH core and OSH modules used if not using a release version
* Build files to build OSH packages (typically one package per type of node)

The suggested folder structure is in this repository and can be cloned to create a new project.
