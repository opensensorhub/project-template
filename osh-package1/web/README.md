This folder contains HTML/Javascript source code and associated resources (e.g. image files) for the web clients to include in this package.

If not using a release version of the OSH JS Toolkit, this folder can include a submodule to link to a specific revision.

We encourage the use of Bower to manage web dependencies of the client code. When not possible, this folder can also include copies of external libraries that are needed by the client code.
